The benefits of teaching R to undergraduates are abundant, but learning to code in R may induce anxiety for students, potentially leading to negative learning outcomes and disengagement. Anecdotes suggest a gender differential in programming anxiety, with women experiencing greater anxiety. Currently, we do not know the extent to which programming anxiety exists in our undergraduate biology classrooms, whether it differs by gender, and what instructors can do to alleviate it. Instructor immediacy has been shown to mediate related anxieties such as quantitative and computer anxiety. Likewise, students' use of adaptive coping strategies may mitigate anxieties. We investigated students' R anxiety within a lower-division ecology course and explored its relationships with gender, instructor immediacy, classroom engagement, and reported coping strategies. Women reported significantly higher R anxiety than men, a gap that narrowed, yet persisted over the semester. In addition, several specific coping skills were associated with decreases in R anxiety and increases in self-concept and sense of control; these differed by gender identity. Our findings can guide future work to identify interventions that lessen programming anxiety in biology classes, especially for women.",,2,21,,,,,,Forrester,Y,UG,US,Ecology,Ecology,Coding anxiety and gender gaps ,Perceptions ,QE

Background: Many students who choose to major in information systems (IS), enter university with little or no experience of learning programming. Few studies have dealt with students' learning to program in the business faculty, who do not necessarily have the computer science goal of programming. It has been shown that undergraduate IS students struggle with programming. Methodology: The qualitative approach was used in this study to determine students' notions of learning to program and to determine their cognitive processes while learning to program in higher education. A cohort of 47 students, who were majoring in Information Systems within the Bachelor of Commerce degree programme were part of the study. Reflective journals were used to allow students to record their experiences and to study in-depth their insights and experiences of learning to program during the course. Using phenomenographic methods, categories of description that uniquely characterises the various ways IS students experience learning to program were determined. Contribution: This paper provides educators with empirical evidence on IS students' experiences of learning to program, which play a crucial role in informing IS educators on how they can lend support and modify their pedagogical approach to teach programming to students who do not necessarily need to have the computer science goal of programming. This study contributes additional evidence that suggests more categories of description for IS students within a business degree. It provides valuable pedagogical insights for IS educators, thus contributing to the body of knowledge Findings: The findings of this study reveal six ways in which IS students' experience the phenomenon, learning to program. These ways, referred to categories of description, formed an outcome space. Recommendations for Practitioners: Use the experiences of students identified in this study to determine approach to teaching and tasks or assessments assigned Recommendation for Researchers: Using phenomenographic methods researchers in IS or IT may determine pedagogical content knowledge in teaching specific aspects of IT or IS. Impact on Society: More business students would be able to program and improve their logical thinking and coding skills. Future Research: Implement the recommendations for practice and evaluate the students' performance.",81-92,,20,Journal of Information Technology Education: Innovations in Practice,,EBSCOhost,,,Govender,N,UG,SA,Information Systems,Information Systems,Student experiences ,,QL

We describe the procedural steps of the project from choosing suitable replication studies to guiding students through the process of conducting a replication, and processing results in a meta-analysis. Based on the experience of more than 80 replications, we summarize how such a project can be implemented. We present practical solutions that have been shown to be successful as well as discuss typical obstacles and how they can be solved. We argue that replication projects are beneficial for all groups involved: Students benefit by being guided through a highly structured protocol and making actual contributions to science. Instructors benefit by using time resources effectively for cumulative science and fulfilling teaching obligations in a meaningful way. The scientific community benefits from the resulting greater number of replications and teaching state-of-the-art methodology.

There is therefore, an opportunity to rethink how institutions can develop innovative data-focussed education programmes, addressing both modern industry and community demands. As both academia and industry strive to integrate applied learning, transferable and enterprise skills into business and sciences, this paper proposes a design based research approach (DBR) for designing such a new interdisciplinary data science teaching curriculum as a foundation to deliver business undergraduate degrees in Business Data Science. Adopting a design science method our proposed DBR illustrates effective utilities for conceptualising and evaluating a fully functional new degree programme -- Bachelor of Business Data Science. Ten senior business information systems academics and five analytics industry practitioners in Victoria, Australia were interviewed in three iterative prototyping phases followed by a final focus group session with business information systems students that evaluated the proposed structure. The findings suggest that proposed DBR ensures the design of an innovative data science degree that may meet growing industry and interdisciplinary demands.

Team-Based Learning (TBL) is a pedagogical strategy that can help educators teach data science better by flipping the classroom to employ small-group collaborative learning to actively engage students in doing data science. A consequence of this teaching method is helping students achieve the workforce-relevant data science learning goals of effective communication, teamwork, and collaboration. We describe the essential elements of TBL: accountability structures and feedback mechanisms to support students collaborating within permanent teams on well-designed application exercises to do data science. The results of our case study of using TBL to teach a modern, introductory data science course indicate that the course effectively taught reproducible data science workflows, beginning R programming, and communication and collaboration. Students also reported much room for improvement in their learning of statistical thinking and advanced R concepts. To help the data science education community adopt this appealing pedagogical strategy, we outline steps for deciding on using TBL, preparing and planning for it, and overcoming potential pitfalls when using TBL to teach data science.",277-296,3,29,,,,,,Vance,Y,UG,US,"Statistics, Data Science",Statistics,Student Learning Outcomes and Learning Goals,Academic,OB

The course modules follow the ‚Äúcrawl, walk, run‚Äù approach to develop the capacity of students to solve increasingly challenging problems with greater independence. During the ‚Äúcrawl‚Äù phase students fill their scientific toolbox, learn instrumentation and skills to be able to design and conduct their own experiments and analyze and communicate their results. For multiple years students analyzed the results of their experiments by hand, or by the assistance of a Laboratory Instructor who may or may not had been proficient in using statistical software. To ‚Äúeven out the playing field‚Äù and to provide an additional tool to the students, we started to teach freshmen and sophomores how to use the statistical program ‚ÄòR‚Äô. ‚ÄòR‚Äô is a comprehensive, programming, graphical and statistical software that will provide significant help with the statistical analysis needed for the research projects conducted in biology labs. It became one of the most popular statistical software in the biological sciences in the past few years. ‚ÄòR‚Äô is an implementation of the statistical programming language ‚ÄúS‚Äù, which was developed at the Bell Laboratories. Every semester, over 400 students learn how to use ‚ÄòR‚Äô in our investigative biology laboratories. After a one-semester biology lab our students do not only walk away with laboratory skills, but by using ‚ÄòR‚Äô, they improve their statistical, mathematical and analytical skills as well. This new addition to our labs has been very successful, and the feedback from the students, TAs and other faculty has been very positive. ‚ÄòR‚Äô is a freeware, and compatible with Unix, Apple and Windows operating systems. The freeware can be downloaded from www.r-project.org. In addition, we also teach students how to use R-studio (www.rstudio.com) that organizes graphs, scripts and variables in a user friendly way.

Universities turn out millions of graduates annually, but at the same time, employers highlight their lack of the requisite skills for sustainable employment. We live today in a world of data, and therefore courses that feature numerical and computational tools to gather and analyse data are to be sourced for and integrated into life sciences' curricula as they provide a number of benefits for both the students and faculty members that are engaged in teaching the courses. The lack of this teaching in undergraduate Microbiology curricula is devastating and leaves a knowledge gap in the graduates that are turned out. This results in an inability of the emerging graduates to compete favourably with their counterparts from other parts of the world. There is a necessity on the part of life science educators to adapt their teaching strategies to best support students' curricula that prepare them for careers in science.

Psychophysiology, and especially the subfield of cognitive electrophysiology, poses challenges for educators because it requires an understanding of complex concepts and experimental design, advanced analysis and programming skills, and access to specialized software and equipment. These challenges are common to other STEM fields as well. We present PURSUE (Preparing Undergraduates for Research in STEM Using Electrophysiology ‚Äì www.PursueERP.com ) as an example initiative that engages open educational practices to create and share freely available electrophysiology training materials. This model uses evidence-based pedagogy to create accessible and flexible materials, an open database with supporting lab-based training resources, and also provides instructor support during implementation. This model can be used for other areas within STEM. We review benefits and challenges of using open science research and publishing practices for training. Open science resources have benefits for both course-based undergraduate research experiences and other types of training by increasing access to publications, software, and code for conducting experiments and analyses, as well as access to data for those who do not have access to research equipment. Further, we argue that coordinated open educational practices are necessary to take full advantage of open science resources for training students.

Following the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework, we aim to characterize the technological and pedagogical knowledge quality of reviewed studies, as we find the content presented to be diverse and incomparable. TPACK is a universally established method for teaching considering information and communication technology. Yet it is seldom used for the analysis of data science pedagogy. To make this framework more structured, we list the tools employed in each reviewed study to summarize technological knowledge quality. We further examine whether each study follows the needs of the Cognitive Apprenticeship theory to summarize the pedagogical knowledge quality in each reviewed study. Of the 23 reviewed studies, 14 met the needs of Cognitive Apprenticeship theory and include hands-on experiences, promote students‚Äô active learning, seeking guidance from the instructor as a coach, introduce students to the real-world industry demands of data and data scientists, and provide meaningful learning resources and feedback across various stages of their data science initiatives.

Because of its transparent and flexible nature, R is increasingly used for data management and analysis in the field of ecology. Consequently, job postings targeting candidates with a bachelor's degree and a required knowledge of R have increased over the past ten years. In this paper, we begin by presenting data from the last ten years demonstrating the increase in the use of R, an open-source programming environment, in ecology and its prevalence as a required skill in job descriptions. We then discuss our experiences teaching undergraduates R in two advanced ecology classes using different approaches. One approach, in a course with a field laboratory, focused on collecting, cleaning, and preparing data for analysis. The other approach, in a course without a field laboratory, focused on analyzing existing datasets and applying the results to content discussed in the lecture portion of the course. Our experiences determined that each approach had strengths and weaknesses. We recommend that above all, instructors of ecology and related subjects should be encouraged to include R in their coursework. Furthermore, instructors should be aware of the following: Learning R is a separate skill from learning statistics; writing R assignments is a significant time commitment for course preparation; and there is a tradeoff between teaching R and teaching content. Determining how one's course fits into the curriculum and identifying resources outside of the classroom for students‚Äô continued practice will ensure that R training is successful and will extend beyond a one-semester course.",e03060,4,11,,,Wiley Online Library,,,Auker,Y,UG,US,Ecology,Ecology,Framework,Framework,OB

We then propose features of instruction that might uniquely facilitate deep understanding and suggest that the connections between a domain‚Äôs core concepts, key representations, and contexts and practices of the world must be made explicit and practiced, over time, in order for students to develop coherent understanding.
